I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Nutritional Sciences but surprisingly found innovative technology a growing interest that I wanted to pursue a career in. Transitioning from the medical field to the tech industry has been fascinating as I have learned more about how automating data can connect the natural and digital world efficiently and securely.

I’m looking forward to growing as a software engineer and I’m especially enthusiastic to learn about blockchain technology and artificial intelligence in the future!

In my free time, I enjoy baking/cooking, acrylic painting, traveling, and exploring new restaurants/bars! Feel free to reach out to me at gracetrc7@gmail.com
